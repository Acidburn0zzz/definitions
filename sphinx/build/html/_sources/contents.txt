This manual is also available in `a PDF version. <nexus.pdf>`_

Contents
==================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   
   preface
   volume1/index
   volume2/index
   authors

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`search`

TODO items
----------------

* fix table column width problems in PDF
* fix math source formatting between html and pdf
  * see examples at http://theoretical-physics.net/dev/src/math/integration.html
* tables, examples, and figures: treat them consistently with titles, captions, and cross-references
* stop the section numbering for very deep subsections (2.1.4.1.2.1.3.1.4.5.1.4.1... is just ridiculous)
* try to get the contents to look like:

  * Preface
  * Volume 1
  * Volume 2

* OR, should we produce two or more separate books?

* note there is a figure number extension: https://bitbucket.org/arjones6/sphinx-numfig/wiki/Home

NeXus home page
---------------

We've had a request for examples to improve the NeXus home page.
Here are some examples that use sphinx in one way or another:

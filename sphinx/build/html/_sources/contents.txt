TODO items
----------

* fix math source formatting between html and pdf
  * see examples at http://theoretical-physics.net/dev/src/math/integration.html
* tables, examples, and figures: treat them consistently with titles, captions, and cross-references
* stop the section numbering for very deep subsections (2.1.4.1.2.1.3.1.4.5.1.4.1... is just ridiculous)
* Should we produce two or more separate books?
* Convert NXDL doc strings into ReST

* note there is a figure number extension: https://bitbucket.org/arjones6/sphinx-numfig/wiki/Home

NeXus home page

We've had a request for examples to improve the NeXus home page.

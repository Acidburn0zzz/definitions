This directory contains the source for an alternative rendering of the NeXus documentation.
The tool used here is sphinx.  It relies on source code files coded in reST.
See the sphinx WWW site for how this works:  http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

These commands are useful on Linux (from the <definitions>/trunk/sphinx directory):
   make clean
   make html
   make latexpdf
   firefox build/html/index.html &
   evince build/latex/nexus.pdf &

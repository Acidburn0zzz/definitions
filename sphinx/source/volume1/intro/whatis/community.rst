NeXus Scientific Community 
-------------------------------------------------------

NeXus began as a group of scientists with the goal of defining a 
common data storage format 
to exchange experimental results 
and to exchange ideas about how to analyze them.

The NeXus Scientific Community
provides the scientific data, advice, and continued involvement
with the NeXus standard. NeXus provides a forum for the scientific
community to exchange ideas in data storage through the NeXus wiki.

The NeXus International Advisory Committee supervises the 
development and maintenance of the NeXus common data 
format for neutron, x-ray, and muon science. 
The NIAC supervises a technical committee to oversee the 
NeXus Application Programmer Interface (NAPI) and the 
NeXus class definitions.

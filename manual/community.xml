        <!-- verbatim from the Introduction -->
	<para>
	    NeXus began as a group of scientists with the goal of defining a
	    common data storage format
	    to exchange experimental results
	    and to exchange ideas about how to analyze them.
        </para>
        <para>
	    The NeXus Scientific Community
	    provides the scientific data, advice, and continued involvement
	    with the NeXus standard. NeXus provides a forum for the scientific
	    community to exchange ideas in data storage through the NeXus wiki.
        </para>
        <para>
	    The NeXus International Advisory Committee supervises the
	    development and maintenance of the NeXus common data
	    format for neutron, x-ray, and muon science.
	    The NIAC supervises a technical committee to oversee the
	    NeXus Application Programmer Interface (NAPI) and the
	    NeXus class definitions.

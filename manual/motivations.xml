            Today:
            * Lots of different data formats
            * Time wasted converting data
            * Old formats no longer capable of delivering for new high throughput detectors
            * Difficult to add additional data
            * Often, for DA multiple different files needed
            * Badly documented formats
            Tomorrow, with NeXus:
            * Single, efficient, platform independent data format
            * All information in one file
            * Self-describing
            * Extendable
        -->
        By the early 1990s, several groups of scientists in the fields of neutron and 
        X-ray science had recognized a common and troublesome pattern in the data acquired 
        at various scientific instruments and user facilities.  Each of these instruments
        and facilities had a locally defined format for recording experimental data.
        With lots of different formats, much of the scientists' time was being wasted in 
        the task of writing import readers for processing and analysis programs.
        As is common, the exact information to be documented from each instrument in a
        data file evolves, such as the implementation of new high-throughput detectors.  
        Many of these formats lacked the generality to extend to the
        new data to be stored, thus another new format was devised.  In such environments,
        the documentation of each generation of data format is often lacking.

                    Przemek Klosowski (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA)

        These scientists proposed methods to store data using 
        a self-describing, extensible format that was already in broad use
        in other scientific disciplines.
        Their proposals formed the basis for the current design of the NeXus 
        standard which was developed at two workshops, SoftNeSS'95 (NIST Sept. 1995) 
        and SoftNeSS'96 (Argonne Oct. 1996), attended by representatives 
        of a range of neutron and x-ray facilities. 
        The NeXus API was released in late 1997.  
        Basic motivations for this standard were:

            While the best representation of a set of observations will vary,
            depending on various conditions, a good suggestion is often known <emphasis>a
                priori</emphasis>. This suggestion is described in the <literal>NXdata</literal>
            element so that any program that is used to browse NeXus data files can provide a

    <section xml:id="UnifiedFormat">
        <title>Unified format for reduction and analysis</title>
        <para> 
            Another important motivation for NeXus, indeed the <emphasis>raison
            d'etre</emphasis>, was the community need to analyze data from different user
            facilities. A single data format that is in use at a variety of facilities
            would provide a major benefit to the scientific community.  This unified format

                <primary>NeXus basic motivation</primary>
                <secondary>unified format</secondary>
            </indexterm>
            should
            be capable of describing any type of data from the scientific experiments,
            at any step of the process from data acquisition to data reduction and analysis.
            This unified format also needs to allow data to be written to storage
            as efficiently as possible to enable use with high-speed data acquisition.

            <emphasis role="bold">Self-description</emphasis>, combined with a reliance on a
            <emphasis role="bold">multi-platform</emphasis> (and thereby <emphasis role="bold">portable</emphasis>) data
            storage format, are valued components of a data storage format where the longevity of
            the data is expected to be longer than the lifetime of the facility at which it is
            acquired. As the name implies, self-description within data files is the practice where
            the structure of the information contained within the file is evident from the file
            itself. A multi-platform data storage format must faithfully represent the data
            identically on a variety of computer systems, regardless of the bit order or byte order
            or word size native to the computer. </para>
        <para> The scientific community continues to grow the various types of data to be expressed
            in data files. This practice is expected to continue as part of the investigative
            process. To gain broad acceptance in the scientific user community, any data storage
            format proposed as a standard would need to be 
            <emphasis role="bold">extendable</emphasis> and continue to provide a means to express the
            latest notions of scientific data. </para>
        <para> The maintenance cost of common data structures meeting the motivations above
            (self-describing, portable, and extendable) is not insurmountable but is often
            well-beyond the research funding of individual members of the muon, neutron, and X-ray
            science communities. Since it is these members that drive the selection of a data
            storage format, it is necessary for the user cost to be as minimal as possible. In this
            case, experience has shown that the format must be in the
            <emphasis role="bold">public-domain</emphasis> for it to be commonly accepted as a standard. A
            benefit of the public-domain aspect is that the source code for the API is open and
            accessible, a point which has received notable comment in the scientific literature.
            <!-- 
                PRJ: For example, there was a letter to the editor of J Appl Cryst 
                in the late 1970s complaining about the increasingly-common practice
                of withholding the source code.  If we find the reference, we should cite it here.

            More recently, NeXus has recognized that part of the scientific community with a
            desire to write and record scientific data, has small data volumes and a large aversion
            to the requirement of a complicated API necessary to access data in binary files such as
            HDF. For such information, the NeXus API <indexterm>
                <primary>API</primary>
            </indexterm> has been extended by the addition of the eXtensible Markup Language<footnote>
                <para> XML: <link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">http://www.w3.org/XML/</link>. There are
                    many other descriptions of XML, for example: <link
                        xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML"
                        >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML</link>

            </footnote> (XML) <indexterm>
                <primary>XML</primary>
            </indexterm> as an alternative to HDF. XML is a text-based format that supports
            compression and structured data and has broad usage in business and e-commerce. While
            possibly complicated, XML files are human readable, and tools for translation and
            extraction are plentiful. The API has routines to read and write XML data and to convert
            between HDF and XML.

    <section xml:id="CommonExchangeFormat">
        <title>NeXus as a Common Data Exchange Format</title>
        <para>By the late 1980s, it had become common practice for a scientific instrument
            or facility to define its own data format, often at the convenience of the local
            computer system. Data from these facilities were not easily interchanged due to various
            differences in computer systems and the compression schemes of binary data. It was
            necessary to contact the facility to obtain a description so that one could write an
            import routine in software. Experience with facilities closing (and subsequent lack of
            access to information describing the facility data format) revealed a significant
            limitation with this common practice.  Further, there existed a 
            <emphasis>N * N</emphasis> number of conversion routines necessary to convert 
            data between various formats.
            In <xref linkend="fig.data-pre-nexus"/>, circles represent different
            data file formats while arrows represent conversion routines.  Note that
            the red circle only maps to one other format.

                <title><emphasis>N</emphasis> separate file formats</title>

            One early idea has been for NeXus to become the common data exchange format,
            and thereby reduce the number of data conversion routines from 
            <emphasis>N * N</emphasis> down to <emphasis>2N</emphasis>, as show in
            <xref linkend="fig.data-post-nexus"/>.

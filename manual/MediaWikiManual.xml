        <title>NeXus Introduction</title>
        <para>In recent years, a number of scientists and computer programmers working in neutron
            and synchrotron facilities around the world came to the conclusion that a common data
            format would fulfil a valuable function in the scattering community. As instrumentation
            becomes more complex and data visualization become more challenging, individual
            scientists, or even institutions, have found it difficult to keep up with new
            developments. A common data format makes it easier, both to exchange experimental
            results and to exchange ideas about how to analyze them. It promotes greater cooperation
            in software development and stimulate the design of more sophisticated visualization
            tools. For additional background information see the [[History|history of the NeXus
            format]]TKlink.</para>
        <para>This section is designed to give a brief introduction to NeXus, the data format that
            has been developed in response to these needs. It explains what a modern data format
            such as NeXus is and how to write simple programs to read and write NeXus files. </para>

                <title>A Set of Subroutines</title>
                <para>In the past, a data format was defined by a document describing the precise
                    location of every item in the data file, either as row and column numbers in an
                    ASCII file, or as record and byte numbers in a binary file. In modern data
                    formats, such as NeXus, the user does not need to know where the data are
                    stored, just what they are called. It is the job of the subroutine library to
                    retrieve the data.</para>
                <para>For example, in NeXus, a program to read in the wavelength of an experiment
                    would contain lines similar to the following: <example>
                        <title>Simple example of reading data</title>
                        <programlisting>
NXopendata (fileID, "wavelength");
NXgetdata (fileID, lambda);
NXclosedata (fileID);
</programlisting>
                    </example> In this example, the program requests the value of the data that has
                    the label <code>wavelength</code>, storing the result in the variable lambda.
                        <code>fileID</code> is a file identifier that is provided by NeXus when the
                    file is opened. </para>
                <para>We shall provide a more complete example when we have discussed the contents
                    of the NeXus files.</para>

                <para>NeXus data files contain two types of entity: data items and data groups. <variablelist>
                        <varlistentry>
                            <term>Data Items</term>
                            <listitem>
                                <para>These can be scalar values or multidimensional arrays of a
                                    variety of sizes (1-byte, 2-byte, 4-byte, 8-byte) and types
                                    (characters, integers, floats). Extra information required to
                                    describe a particular data item, such as the data units, can be
                                    stored as a data attribute. </para>
                            </listitem>
                        </varlistentry>
                        <varlistentry>
                            <term>Data Groups</term>
                            <listitem>
                                <para>These are like folders that can contain a number of data items
                                    and/or other groups.</para>
                            </listitem>
                        </varlistentry>
                    </variablelist></para>
                <para>In fact, a NeXus file can be viewed as a computer file system. Just as files
                    are stored in folders (or subdirectories) to make them easy to locate, so NeXus
                    data items are stored in groups. The group hierarchy is designed to make it easy
                    to navigate a NeXus file.</para>

                    <title>Example of a NeXus File</title>
                    <para>The following diagram shows an example of a NeXus file represented as a
                        tree structure. <figure>

                            </mediaobject>
                        </figure> Note that each data item is identified by a name, e.g., counts,
                        but each group is identified both by a name and, in parentheses, a class
                        identifier, e.g., monitor (NXmonitor). The class names, which all begin with
                        NX, define the sort of data items that the group should contain, in this
                        case, counts from a beamline monitor. The hierarchical design, with data
                        items nested in groups, makes it easy to identify information if you are
                        browsing through a file. </para>

                    <para>Here are some of the important classes found in nearly all NeXus files. A

                                    <para>The top level of any NeXus file contains one or more
                                        groups with the class NXentry. These contain all the data
                                        that is required to describe an experimental run or scan.
                                        Each NXentry typically contains a number of groups
                                        describing sample information (class NXsample), instrument
                                        details (class NXinstrument), and monitor counts (class

                        This hides the complexity from generic file browsers, but makes the
                        information available in an intuitively obvious way if it is required.

                    <title>Simple Example</title>
                    <para>NeXus data files do not need to be complicated. In fact, the following
                        diagram shows an extremely simple NeXus file that could be used to transfer
                        data between programs. <figure>
                            <title>Simple Example</title>
                            <mediaobject>

                        </figure> This illustrates the fact that the structure of NeXus files is
                        extremely flexible. It can accommodate very complex instrumental
                        information, if required, but it can also be used to store very simple data
                        sets. </para>

                <title>A Set of Instrument Definitions</title>
                <para>If the design principles are followed, it will be easy for anyone browsing a
                    NeXus file to understand what it contains, without any prior information.
                    However, if you are writing visualization or analysis software, you will need to
                    know precisely what information is contained in advance. For that reason, NeXus
                    provides a way of defining the format for particular instrument types, e.g.,
                    time-of-flight small angle neutron scattering. This requires some agreement by
                    the relevant communities, but would allow the development of much more portable
                    software.</para>
                <para>These instrument definitions are being formalized as XML files, using a
                    specially devised syntax that specifies the names of data items, and whether
                    they are optional or required. The following is an example of such a file for
                    the simple NeXus file shown above. <example>

                    formats are available, namely HDF4, HDF5, and XML. The NeXus library may be
                    configured to support all of them, or any nonempty subset. Applications that
                    create NeXus files need to decide (or let the user decide) in which low-level
                    format data shall be stored. Generic data analysis applications should be able
                    to read any low-level format.</para>

            <title>How do I write a NeXus file?</title>
            <para>The NeXus Application Program Interface (API) provides a set of subroutines that
                make it easy to read and write NeXus files. These subroutines are available in C,
                Fortran 77, Fortran 90, Java, and IDL. Access from other languages, such as Python,
                is anticipated in the near future. It is also possible to read NeXus files in a
                number of data analysis tools, such as LAMP, ISAW, and Open GENIE.</para>
            <para>The API uses a very simple "state" model to navigate through a NeXus file. When
                you open a file, the API provides a file "handle", which then stores the current
                location, i.e. which group and/or data item is currently open. Read and write
                operations then act on the currently open entity. In the following, we walk through
                some parts of a typical NeXus program written in C. See the API section for a more
                complete version.</para>
            <para> First, it is necessary to open the file, specifying whether we want read or write
                access. <example>
                    <title>Open a file</title>
                    <programlisting>#include "napi.h"

 int main()
 {
   NXhandle fileID;
   NXopen ('NXfile.nxs', NXACC_CREATE, &amp;fileID);</programlisting>
                </example> The file is opened with "create" access (implying write access), and the
                API returns a file identifier of type NXhandle. Next, we create an NXentry group to
                contain the scan using NXmakegroup and then open it for access using NXopengroup. <example>
                    <title>Create an entry</title>
                    <programlisting>
NXmakegroup (fileID, "Entry", "NXentry");
NXopengroup (fileID, "Entry", "NXentry");
    </programlisting>
                </example> The plottable data is contained within an NXdata group, which must also
                be created and opened. <example>
                    <title>Create data group</title>
                    <programlisting>
NXmakegroup (fileID, "Data", "NXdata");
NXopengroup (fileID, "Data", "NXdata");</programlisting>
                </example> To create a data item, call NXmakedata, specifying the data name, type
                (NX_FLOAT32), rank (in this case, 1), and length of the array (n_t). Then, it can be
                opened for writing. <example>
                    <title>Create data array</title>
                    <programlisting> NXmakedata (fileID, "time_of_flight", NX_FLOAT32, 1, &amp;n_t);
  NXopendata (fileID, "time_of_flight")</programlisting>
                </example> Then write the data using NXputdata. <example>
                    <title>Write the data</title>
                    <programlisting>  NXputdata (fileID, t);</programlisting>
                </example> With data item is still open, we can also add some data attributes, such
                as the data units, which are specified as a character string (type NX_CHAR) that is
                12 bytes long. <example>
                    <title>Add an attribute</title>
                    <programlisting>NXputattr (fileID, "units", "microseconds", 12, NX_CHAR);</programlisting>
                </example> Then we close the data item before opening another. In fact, the API will
                do this automatically if you attempt to open another data item, but it is better
                style to close it yourself. <example>
                    <title>Close the data array</title>
                    <programlisting>NXclosedata (fileID);</programlisting>
                </example> The remaining data items in this group are added in a similar fashion.
                Note that the indentation whenever a new data item or group are opened is just
                intended to make the structure of the NeXus file more transparent. <example>
                    <title>The rest of the data group</title>
                    <programlisting>    NXmakedata (fileID, "polar_angle", NX_FLOAT32, 1, &amp;n_p);
       NXopendata (fileID, "polar_angle");
         NXputdata (fileID, polar_angle);
         NXputattr (fileID, "units", "degrees", 7, NX_CHAR);
       NXclosedata (fileID);
       dims[0] = n_t;
       dims[1] = n_p;
       NXmakedata (fileID, "counts", NX_INT32, 2, dims);
       NXopendata (fileID, "counts");
         NXputdata (fileID, counts);
       NXclosedata (fileID);</programlisting>
                </example> Finally, close the groups (NXdata and NXentry) before closing the file
                itself. <example>
                    <title>Cleanup</title>
                    <programlisting>   NXclosegroup (fileID);
   NXclosegroup (fileID);
   NXclose (&amp;fileID);
   return;
}</programlisting>
                </example></para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>How do I read a NeXus file?</title>
            <para>Reading a NeXus file is almost identical to writing one. Obviously, it is not
                necessary to call NXmakedata since the item already exists, but it is necessary to
                call one of the query routines to find out the rank and length of the data before
                allocating an array to store it.</para>
            <para>Here is part of a program to read the time-of-flight array from the file created
                by the example above. <example>
                    <title>File read example</title>
                    <programlisting> NXopen ('NXfile.nxs', NXACC_READ, &amp;fileID);
   NXopengroup (fileID, "Entry", "NXentry");
     NXopengroup (fileID, "Data", "NXdata");
       NXopendata (fileID, "time_of_flight");
         NXgetinfo (fileID, &amp;rank, dims, &amp;datatype);
         NXmalloc ((void **) &amp;tof, rank, dims, datatype);
         NXgetdata (fileID, tof);
       NXclosedata (fileID);
     NXclosegroup (fileID);
   NXclosegroup (fileID);
 NXclose (fileID);</programlisting>
                </example></para>
            <para>NeXus files can also be viewed by a command-line browser, NXbrowse, which is
                included with the NeXus API. The following is an example session of using NXbrowse
                to view a data file from the LRMECS spectrometer at IPNS. The following commands are

        <para>The NeXus Design page lists the group classes from which a NeXus file is constructed.
            They provide the glossary of items that could, in principle, be stored in a
            standard-conforming NeXus file (other items may be inserted into the file if the author
            wishes, but they won't be part of the standard). If you are going to include a
            particular piece of metadata, consult the class definitions to find out what to call it.
            However, to assist those writing data analysis software, it is useful to provide more
            than a glossary; it is important to define the required contents of NeXus files that
            contain data from particular classes of neutron, x-ray, or muon instrument.</para>
        <para>As part of the NeXus standard, we have identified a number of generic instruments that
            describe an appreciable number of existing instruments around the world. Although not
            identical in every detail, they share enough common characteristics, and more
            importantly, they require sufficiently similar modes of data analysis, to make a
            standard description useful. They are in the process of being defined for the NeXus
            standard. The definitions will be in XML using the NeXus Meta-DTD format.</para>

                <answer>
                    <para>This is continually evolving. It has been used as the instrument format
                        for several years on some or all instruments at a number of facilities
                        including PSI (Switzerland), LLB (France), and LANSCE (USA). It will be used
                        on all future instrumentation at ISIS (UK), NIST (USA), ANSTO (Australia)
                        and instruments using the new data acquisition system at IPNS (USA).
                        Finally, it has been formally adopted by major facilities under
                        construction, the SNS (USA), JPARC (Japan) and Diamond Light Source

                <answer>
                    <para>NeXus files can be used to store both extremely simple data, e.g. a single
                        (x,y) array, and highly complex instrument descriptions. In fact, the
                        original intention of the NeXus data format was to provide a way of
                        interchanging data between facilities and their user communities. However,
                        the power of NeXus hierarchical design has led to its adoption as a standard
                        archiving format by several major facilities, such as ISIS, LANSCE, and the
                        SNS.</para>

                <answer>
                    <para>A NeXus file can contain a number of NXentry groups, which may represent
                        different scans in an experiment, or sample and calibration runs, etc. In
                        many cases, though by no means all, the instrument has the same
                        configuration so that it would be possible to save space by storing the
                        NXinstrument group once and using multiple links in the remaining NXentry
                        groups. It is assumed that the sample and monitor information would be more
                        likely to change from run to run, and so should be stored at the top
                    level.</para>

                    <para>Why are the NeXus classes so complicated? I'll never store all that
                        information</para>
                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>The NeXus classes are essentially glossaries of terms. If you need to
                        store a piece of information, consult the class definitions to see if it has
                        been defined. If so, use it. However, it is not compulsory to include every
                        item that has been defined if it is not relevant to your experiment. On the
                        other hand, if there is an NeXus definition for your instrument, you are
                        recommended to include all the compulsory items if you want to use standard
                        software to analyze your data.</para>

                <question>
                    <para>I want to produce an instrument definition. How do I go about it?</para>
                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>The first thing is to check whether the instrument you are interested in
                        is already being defined by an instrument editor. Check the list on the
                        NeXus Instruments page. The NeXus International Advisory Committee is
                        responsible for appointing editors of special interest groups that wish to
                        become a part of the standard, so contact the Executive Secretary, if a
                        group does not yet exist. Of course, if you want to produce your own private
                        definition for personal use, you are free to do so without our approval
                        although we encourage people to share what they are doing . If you are an
                        editor, the process of defining an instrument should be quite simple: <orderedlist>
                            <listitem>
                                <para>Make sure that the data you wish to analyze are stored in
                                    NXdata groups. The rest of the definition is to supply what is
                                    necessary for simple analysis of the data, for example, the
                                    detector positions and incident wavelength for a x-ray powder
                                    diffraction measurement. </para>
                            </listitem>
                            <listitem>
                                <para>Study the base classes to decide which ones are essential for
                                    your definition. If you believe that a new base class is needed,
                                    contact the NIAC with a proposal. </para>
                            </listitem>
                            <listitem>
                                <para>Select those data items and groups that you consider important
                                    in analyzing data from your instrument. </para>
                            </listitem>
                        </orderedlist> Insert the relevant grep character, as defined in the NeXus
                        Meta-DTD format to denote the number of occurrences. If the item is optional
                        ("?" or "*"), then it does not need to be added to your definition.</para>
                    <para>If you encounter any problems because the classes are not sufficient to
                        describe your configuration, please contact the NIAC Executive Secretary
                        explaining the problem, and post a suggestion at the relevant class wiki
                        page. The NIAC is always willing to consider proposals to amend the base
                        classes. The procedures are defined in the NIAC constitution. </para>

..  verbatim from the Introduction

NeXus began as a group of scientists with the goal of defining a
common data storage format to exchange experimental results
and to exchange ideas about how to analyze them.

The :index:`NeXus Scientific Community <NeXus; Community>`
provides the scientific data, advice, and continued involvement
with the NeXus standard. NeXus provides a forum for the scientific
community to exchange ideas in data storage through the NeXus wiki.

	pair: NeXus International Advisory Committee; NIAC

The NeXus International Advisory Committee (NIAC) supervises the
development and maintenance of the NeXus common data
format for neutron, X-ray, and muon science.
The NIAC supervises a technical committee to oversee the
NeXus Application Programmer Interface (NAPI) and the
NeXus class definitions.

There are several mechanisms in place in order to coordinate the development of NeXus
with the larger community.

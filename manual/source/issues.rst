=====================
NeXus Issue Reporting
=====================

NeXus is using :ref:`TRAC <http://trac.edgewall.org>` [#]_ for problem/issue reporting.
The issue reports (see *View current issues*
below) are used to guide the NeXus developers in
resolving problems as well as implementing new features.  As such,
the TRAC tickets for the *code* and *definitions* repositories form the
basis of a *roadmap* :index:`for NeXus <roadmap>`.
You can browse issues without logging on, but to report issues
you will need to login using your NeXus WIKI username and password
(the :ref:`subversion login notes <Subversion>` mentioned for write 
access to the :ref:`Subversion Server <Subversion>` apply to TRAC login, too).

Whenever an update is made to a ticket, a message is also
posted to the appropriate
:ref:`ticket mailing list <MailingLists>`.

                Most of the content from the old NeXus mediawiki documentation is included.
                Some new wiki content has been introduced but should be easy to
                identify for inclusion in the manual.

            <para>
                Nearly complete but still much finishing work remains.
                The description of dimensions and the description of the 
                coordinate system needs major revision and improvement.
                More examples are needed.
                The manual is now divided into two volumes.
                Volume I is the User Manual, Volume II is the Reference Documentation.
                Much of the NXDL chapter in Volume II is autogenerated from the 
                <literal>nxdl.xsd</literal> Schema 
                and the NXDL source files.
            </para>
            <para>
                Initial release of NXDL, manual, and next release of NAPI (compatibility release),
                manual in editing stage, packaging tools need to be built.

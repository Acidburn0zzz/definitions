            proposals by  Przemek Klososki (NIST), Jonathan Tischler (APS) and Mark Koennnecke (then ISIS)
            were joined to form the basis of the current NeXus format. After reviewing the different scientific 
            data formats available in 1996, it was decided to use HDF-4 as it provided the best grouping support. 
            The basic structure of a NeXus file was agreed upon.  At SoftNeSS 1996 (at
                ANL) the NeXus proposal was refined some more. </para></listitem>

            for the new version of HDF, HDF-5, released by the HDF group. HDF-4 imposed limits on file 
            sizes and the number of objects in a file. These issues were resolved with HDF-5. The NeXus API 
            abstracted the difference between the tow physical file formats away form the user.

            of people were no longer good enough to oversee the development of NeXus. This lead to the 
            formation of the NeXus International Advisory Committee (NIAC) which strives to include 
            representatives of all major stake holders in NeXus. A first meeting was 
            held at CalTech. Since 2003, the NIAC meets very year to discuss all matters NeXus.

            The community asked the NeXus team to provide an ASCII based physical file format which allows 
            them to edit their scientific results in emacs. This lead to the development of a XML NeXus physical 
            format. This was released with NeXus API version 3.0.0. </para></listitem>

            The NeXus Definition Language (NXDL) is defined.
            </link> Before NXDL NeXus used another XML format, meta-DTD, for defining base classes and 
            application definitions. There were several problems with meta-DTD, the biggest one being that it was not 
            easy to validate against it. NXDL was designed to circumvent these problems and all current nase classes and 
            application definitions were ported into the NXDL. </para></listitem>

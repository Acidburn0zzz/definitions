        This documentation is in transition from the NeXus wiki
        site to DocBook.  Simultaneously, NeXus is introducing the
        NeXus Definition Language (NXDL) to define base classes and 
        application definitions.  Parts of the manual may still need
        revision to conform to the NXDL.

        As part of this transition of the documentation from Mediawiki 
        to DocBook, additional examples have been 
        <!-- -er-, will be --> 
        added to respond to
        inquiry from the users of the NeXus standard about implementation
        and usage.  Hopefully these examples and the new NXDL will reduce 
        the learning barriers incurred by those new to NeXus.

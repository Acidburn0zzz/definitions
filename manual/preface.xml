        With this edition of the manual, NeXus introduces a complete version
        of the documentation of the NeXus standard.  The content from the wiki
        has been converted, augmented (in some parts significantly), clarified,
        and indexed.  The 
        NeXus Definition Language (NXDL) is introduced now
        to define base classes and 
        application definitions.  
        NXDL replaces the previous method (meta-DTD) to define NeXus classes.
        NeXus base classes and instrument definitions
        are now assigned to one of three classifications: 
        (1) <emphasis>bases classes</emphasis> (that represent the components used 
        to build a NeXus data file), 
        (2) <emphasis>application definitions</emphasis> (used to define a minimum 
        set of data for a specific purpose such as scientific data processing 
        or an instrument definition), 
        and
        (3) <emphasis>contributed definitions</emphasis> (definitions and specifications
        that are in an incubation status before reatification by the NIAC).
        Additional examples have been added to respond to
        inquiry from the users of the NeXus standard about implementation
        and usage.  Hopefully, the improved documentation with
        more examples and the new NXDL will reduce 
        the learning barriers incurred by those new to NeXus.

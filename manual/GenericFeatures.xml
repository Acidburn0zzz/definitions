        <para>The NeXus definition sometimes requires to 
            have access to the same data in different groups 
        in the same file. For example: detector data has to live in the 
        <code>NXinstrument/NXdetector</code> group 
            but may be needed in <code>NXdata</code> for automatic plotting. 
            Rather then replicating the data NeXus uses 
        links in such situations. Links are pointers to existing data somewhere else. 
        The concept is very much like 
        symbolic links in a unix filesystem</para>

        <title>Monitors as a special kind of data</title>

            have a special place in NeXus files. Monitors are crucial to normalize data.
         To emphasize their role, monitors are not stored in the 
            <code>NXinstrument</code> hierarchy but on <code>NXentry</code> level 
          in their own groups as there might be multiple monitors. Of special 
          importance is the monitor in a group called <code>control</code>. 
          This is the main monitor against which the data has to be normalized. 
          This group also contains the counting control information, 
          i.e. counting mode, times, etc.
        </para>
        <para>
          Monitor data may be multidimensional. Good examples are scan monitors 
          where a monitor value per scan point is expected or 
          time-of-flight monitors.

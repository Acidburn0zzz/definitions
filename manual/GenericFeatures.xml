    <title>Generic features of NeXus files</title>
    <!-- TODO: write about generic features or leave this chapter out -->
    
    <section><title>Groups, Fields, and Attributes</title>
        <para>The NeXus definition sometimes requires to have access to the same data in different groups 
        in the same file. For example: detector data has to live in the NX/instrument/NXdetector group 
        but may be needed in NXdata for automatic plotting. Rather then replicating the data NeXus uses 
        links in such situations. Links are pointers to existing data somewhere else. The concept is very much like 
        symbolic links in a unix filesystem</para>

    <section><title>Monitors as a special kind of data</title>
        <para>Monitors have a special place in NeXus files. Monitors are crucial to normalize data.
         To emphasize their role, monitors are not stored in the NXinstrument hierarchy but on NXentry level 
          in their own groups as there might be multiple monitors. Of special importance is the monitor in 
          a group called control. This is the main monitor against which the data has to be normalized. This group 
          also contains the counting control information, i.e. counting mode, times, etc. Monitor data may be 
          multidimensional. Good examples are scan monitors where a monitor value per scan point is expected or 
          time-of-flight monitors.

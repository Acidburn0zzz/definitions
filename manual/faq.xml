            <question>
                <para>How many facilities use NeXus?</para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>This is continually evolving. It has been used as the instrument format
                    for several years on some or all instruments at a number of facilities
                    including PSI (Switzerland), LLB (France), LANSCE (USA), and APS (USA). It
                    will be used on all future instrumentation at ISIS (UK), NIST (USA), and
                    ANSTO (Australia). Finally, it has been formally adopted by major facilities
                    under construction, the SNS (USA), JPARC (Japan) and Diamond Light Source
                    (UK).</para>

            <question>
                <para>NeXus files are only useful for archiving instrumental data, aren't
                    they?</para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>NeXus files can be used to store both extremely simple data, e.g. a single
                    (x,y) array, and highly complex instrument descriptions. In fact, the
                    original intention of the NeXus data format was to provide a way of
                    interchanging data between facilities and their user communities. However,
                    the power of NeXus hierarchical design has led to its adoption as a standard
                    archiving format by several major facilities, such as ISIS, LANSCE, and the
                    SNS.</para>

            <question>
                <para>Why aren't <code>NXsample</code> and <code>NXmonitor</code> groups stored
                    in the <code>NXinstrument</code> group?</para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>A NeXus file can contain a number of <code>NXentry</code> groups, which
                    may represent different scans in an experiment, or sample and calibration
                    runs, etc. In many cases, though by no means all, the instrument has the
                    same configuration so that it would be possible to save space by storing the
                        <code>NXinstrument</code> group once and using multiple links in the
                    remaining <code>NXentry</code> groups. It is assumed that the sample and
                    monitor information would be more likely to change from run to run, and so
                    should be stored at the top level.</para>

                <para>Any program whose aim is to identify plottable data should use the

                                If so, the names are defined as a comma-delimited string within

            <question>
                <para>Why are the NeXus classes so complicated? I'll never store all that
                    information</para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>The NeXus classes are essentially glossaries of terms. If you need to
                    store a piece of information, consult the class definitions to see if it has
                    been defined. If so, use it. However, it is not compulsory to include every
                    item that has been defined if it is not relevant to your experiment. On the
                    other hand, if there is a NeXus definition for your instrument, you are
                    recommended to include all the compulsory items if you want to use standard
                    software to analyze your data.</para>

                <para>If you encounter any problems because the classes are not sufficient to
                    describe your configuration, please contact the NIAC Executive Secretary
                    explaining the problem, and post a suggestion at the relevant class wiki
                    page. The NIAC <indexterm>

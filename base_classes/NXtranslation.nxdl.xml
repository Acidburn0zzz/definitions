			(x,y,z)}{This field and the angle field describe the position of a component. 
			For absolute position, the origin is the scattering center (where a perfectly 
			aligned sample would be) with the z-axis pointing downstream and the y-axis 
			pointing gravitationally up. For a relative position the NXtranslation is 
			taken into account before the NXorientation. The axes are right-handed and 
			orthonormal.

        <doc>The orientation information is stored as direction cosines. The direction cosines will
            be between the local coordinate directions and the reference directions (to origin or
            relative NXgeometry). Calling the local unit vectors (x',y',z') and the reference unit
            vectors (x,y,z) the six numbers will be [x' dot x, x' dot y, x' dot z, y' dot x, y' dot
            y, y' dot z] where "dot" is the scalar dot product (cosine of the angle between the unit
            vectors). The unit vectors in both the local and reference coordinates are right-handed
            and orthonormal.</doc>

	 			    The chemical formula specified using CIF conventions.
	 			    The Abbreviated version of CIF standard: 
	 			    1. Only recognized element symbols may be used. 
	 			    2. Each element symbol is followed by a 'count' number. A count of '1' may be omitted. 
	 			    3. A space or parenthesis must separate each cluster of (element symbol + count). 
	 			    4. Where a group of elements is enclosed in parentheses, the multiplier for the group 
	 			         must follow the closing parentheses. That is, all element and group multipliers 
	 			         are assumed to be printed as subscripted numbers. 
	 			    5. Unless the elements are ordered in a manner that corresponds to their 
	 			         chemical structure, the order of the elements within any group or moiety 
	 			         depends on whether or not carbon is present. If carbon is present, the order 
	 			         should be: C, then H, then the other elements in alphabetical order of their 
	 			         symbol. If carbon is not present, the elements are listed purely in alphabetic 
	 			         order of their symbol. This is the 'Hill' system used by Chemical Abstracts

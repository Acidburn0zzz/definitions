        Suggestions for adding to this manual (this could be added to a "colophon" DocBook section):
        
        Look for some other "section" such as "introduction.xml" and act similarly.  
        Any examples go as text files in the examples/ subdir and are pulled into the 
        DocBook inside a programlisting using xi:include elements.  Look for the pattern 
        or wing it.  If you are game for it, add indexterms.  Many examples of the 
        constructs you might use are already in the manual.

        svn propset svn:keywords Id strides.xml
        svn propset svn:eol-style native strides.xml

                    In the first meeting, 
                    Mark Koennecke and Jon Tischler were invited to meet with representatives 
                    from all the major U.S. neutron scattering laboratories 
                    at Argonne National Laboratory to discuss future software 
                    development for the analysis and visualization of neutron data.
                    One of the main recommendations of <emphasis>SoftNeSS'94</emphasis> 
                    was that a common data format should be developed.

				    after reviewing the different scientific data formats discussed,
                    it was decided to use HDF-4
                    as it provided the best grouping support. 
					The basic structure of a NeXus file was agreed upon. 
                    the various data format proposals were combined into a single document by
                    Przemek Klosowski (NIST), Mark Koennecke (then ISIS),
					Jonathan Tischler (ORNL and APS/ANL), and Ray Osborn (IPNS/ANL)
                    coauthored the first proposal for the NeXus scientific data

                <para>NeXus API version 2.0.0 is released. This version brought support for the new
                    version of HDF, HDF-5, released by the HDF group. HDF-4 imposed limits on file
                    sizes and the number of objects in a file. These issues were resolved with
                    HDF-5. The NeXus API abstracted the difference between the two physical file
                    formats away form the user. </para>

                <para>In 2003, NeXus had arrived at a stage where informal gatherings of a group of
                    people were no longer good enough to oversee the development of NeXus. This lead
                    to the formation of the NeXus International Advisory Committee (NIAC) which
                    strives to include representatives of all major stake holders in NeXus. A first
                    meeting was held at CalTech. Since 2003, the NIAC meets every year to discuss
                    all matters NeXus. </para>

                    the development of a XML NeXus physical format. This was released with NeXus API

                    Previously, NXDL NeXus used another XML format, meta-DTD, for defining base
                    classes and application definitions. There were several problems with meta-DTD,
                    the biggest one being that it was not easy to validate against it. NXDL was
                    designed to circumvent these problems and all current base classes and
                    application definitions were ported into the NXDL. </para>

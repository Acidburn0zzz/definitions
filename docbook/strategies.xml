    <title>Strategies for storing information in NeXus data files</title>
    <para>
        NeXus may appear daunting, at first, to use.  The number of base classes
        is quite large as well as is the number of application definitions.  This chapter
        describes some of the strategies that have been recommended for how to store
        information in NeXus data files.
        <indexterm><primary>strategies</primary></indexterm>
        When we use the term <emphasis>storing</emphasis>, some might be helped if they consider
        this as descriptions for how to <emphasis>classify</emphasis> their data.  
        
        It is intended for this chapter to grow, with the addition of different use cases
        as they are presented for suggestions.

            Perhaps the simplest case

            might be either a step scan with two or more
            columns of data.  Another simple case might be a single image acquired
            by an area detector.  In either of these hypothetical 
            cases, the situation is so simple
            that there is little addition information available to be described
            (for whatever reason).

            <title>Step scan with two or more data columns</title>
            <para>
                Consider the case where we wish to store the data from a step scan.
                This case may involve two or more <emphasis>related</emphasis> 
                1-D arrays of data to be saved, each 
                having the same length. For our hypothetical case, we'lll
                have these positioners as arrays:
                <literal>ar</literal>,
                <literal>ay</literal>, and
                <literal>dy</literal>, and these arrays as detectors:
                <literal>I0</literal>,
                <literal>I00</literal>,
                <literal>time</literal>,
                <literal>Epoch</literal>, and
                <literal>photodiode</literal>.

        simple instrument, no application definition
        simple instrument, with application definition
        instrument with multiple detectors, no application definition
        instrument with multiple detectors, with application definition
        instrument with multiple, simultaneous application definitions
        instrument with rapidly changing needs
